# LGL Interpreter

## 1 More Capabilities

In this part of the README the additional capabilities from the subtask `1) More Capabilities` will be discussed.

### Documentation

- **do_multiplizieren**: Multiplies 2 numbers. Syntax is a follows: `["multiplizieren", ["aufrufen", var1], ["aufrufen", var2]]`. Note that the user can either pass variables and call them via the `aufrufen` function or pass numbers directly.

- **do_dividieren**: Divides 2 numbers. Syntax is a follows: `["dividieren", ["aufrufen", var1], ["aufrufen", var2]]`. Note that the user can either pass variables and call them via the `aufrufen` function or pass numbers directly.

- **do_hochrechnen**: Implementation of power operations. Syntax is a follows: `["hochrechnen", ["aufrufen", number], ["aufrufen", exponent]]`. Note that the user can either pass variables and call them via the `aufrufen` function or pass numbers directly.

- **do_ausgeben**: Print all arguments. An unlimited amount of arguments can be passed. If a string is passed the string is printed, or the user can also pass a function with a return value and that return value will be printed. The syntax is as follows: `["ausgeben", ..., ..., ...]`

- **kleinerAls**: Evaluates true if var1 is smaller that var2. Syntax is as follows: `["kleinerAls", ["aufrufen", var1], ["aufrufen", var2]]`.

- **groesserAls**: Evaluates true if var1 is greater that var2. Syntax is as follows: `["kleinerAls", ["aufrufen", var1], ["aufrufen", var2]]`.

- **gleich**: Evaluates true if var1 and var2 are equal. Syntax is as follows: `["kleinerAls", ["aufrufen", var1], ["aufrufen", var2]]`.

- **do_waehrend**: Executes a while loop. The syntax is as follows: `["waehrend", while_condition(e.g. ["setzen", "var1", "test"]), while_statement(e.g. ["abfolge", ["ausgeben", ["abrufen","i"]], ["setzen", "i",["addieren", ["abrufen", "i"], 1]]])]`. The user has to make sure to define the variable he is using in the while loop beforehand with `setzten`. Also he has to include an increment in his while_statement.

- **do_liste**: Creates a list of a predefined size. The syntax is as follows: `["liste", size, "list_name", list]`. In the input list operations, numbers or strings can be passed.

- **do_listen_wert_holen**: Gets a value of a list at a certain position. Syntax is as follows: `["listen_wert_holen", "list_name", index]`

- **do_listen_wert_setzen**: Sets a value at a certain position in a list. Syntax is as follows: `["listen_wert_setzen", "list_name", index, new_value]`. The new_value can be an operation, string or number.

- **do_lexikon**: Creates a new dictionary. Syntax is as follows: `["lexikon", "dict_name", [[key1, val1], [key2, val2]]]`. The keys and values can be an operation, string or number.

- **do_lexikon_wert_holen**: Gets a value in a dictionary with a certain key. Syntax is as follows: `["lexikon_wert_holen", "dict_name", "keyname"]`

- **do_lexikon_wert_setzen**: Sets a value in a dictioniary at a certain key. Syntax is as follows: `["lexikon_wert_setzen", "dict_name", "keyname", new_value]`. The new_value can be an operation, string or number.

- **do_lexika_zusammenfuehren**: Merges 2 dictionaries into a new dictionary. The syntax is as follows: `["lexika_zusammenfuehren", "new_dict_name", "dict1_name", "dict2_name"]`. Note that the original dictionaries are deleted after the merge.

### Decisions Taken

**Input parameters and variables**

- In the functions `do_subtrahieren`, `do_multiplizieren`, `do_dividieren` and `do_hochrechene` all inputs can be passed either as numbers or as an operation.

- In the function `do_ausgeben` either operations or strings can be passed as input parameters.

- In the `do_waehrend` function, as the while_condition and while statemnt only operations can be passed.

- In the `do_liste` function, as a size input operations or numbers can be passed. The list_name has to be a string or a "aufrufen" call as well as in the other list operations (do_listen_wert_holen, do_listen_wert_setzen) The initial list items have to be passed as a list. The initial list can also contain operations, e.g. "aufrufen". In the other list operations the position can be passed as a number or operation.

- The size input and the list index input are rounded with the `round()` function in order to avoid errors if a float is passed, or the result of an operation returns a float.

- The dictionary operations have a similar behaviour to the list operations.

**Keeping things clean**

- If two dictinaries are merged using the `do_lexika_zusammenfuehren` function, the original dictionaries are deleted and only the merged dictionary is kept in order to avoid dublicate date.

### Execution

- the following line has to be executed in the terminal for the code to work with the LGL: `python lgl_interpreter.py example_operations.gsc`

## 2 An Object System

In this part of the README the additional capabilities from the subtask `2) An Object System` will be discussed.

### Documentation

- **do_machen**: Used to instantiate objects based on class definition. The syntax is as follows: `["machen", ["abrufen", "class_name"], "arg1", "arg2"]`. The input is the class name and any additional arguments that are needed to create an object.

- **find**: This function is not called in the LGL, but is needed in the object system. The usage is to find a method in a class or its parent class. After giving it the class name and the method name, it first searches the method in the class. If the method is not found, it searches recursively in the parent class.

- **do_rufen**: Used to call a method on an object. The syntax is as follows: `["rufen", ["abrufen", "object_name"], "method_name", "arg1"]`. The input is the object, method name and any additional arguments that are need for the method. The function uses the **find** function to locate the method.

### Decisions Taken

**Object Creation**

- To allow classes to have its own unique initialization process, the system first receives the class definition and then calls the `_new` method defined in the class.

**Method finding**

- To respect the principles of object-oriented programming and inheritance the system first searches for the method in the object's class before looking further in the inheritance.

**Error handling**

- When a method is not found, the function `find` throws an error. This ensures that not existing methods cannot be executed.

**Polymorphism**

- With the help of the operations made in Task 1, polymorphism also works.

### Execution

- the following line has to be executed in the terminal for the code to work with the LGL: `python lgl_interpreter.py example_class.gsc`

## 3 Tracing

In this part of the README the additional capabilities from the subtask `3) Tracing` will be discussed.

### Documentation

_lgl_interpreter.py_

- extend `main` with the possibility of tracing the file dding an optional argument: --trace trace_file.log
- if --trace trace_file.log is added trace_file.log will be opened and passed to do as the named parameter file

- `decorator_funciton` takes as argument the original function which is wrapped with `@decorator_function`
- `wrapper_function` implements the optional possibility of tracing by checking if a logging file was passed.
- If so it logs the information of the original function to the trace_file.log file in the csv format: `unique_id`, `function_name`, `start/stop`, `start_time/ stop_time`
  start_time and stop_time is implemented using the datetime api

_reporting.py_

- can be executed with `reporting.py trace_file.log`

- `get_function_data` takes the logged data from lgl_interpreter and creates a dictionary which keeps track of all the functions called,
  how often the function was called, the time all the calls to the function took and the average time the execution of
  the function took. In the format of e.g. {'do': [1, 23, 23]}

### Decisions Taken

- we use the prettytable to formate and output the data of the dictionary returned by `get_function_data`
